About me
======
I am a Ph.D. candidate at Indiana University. I major in Computational Linguistics and minor in Computer Science. My research interests are machine learning approaches for NLP, artificial emotional intelligence, and sequence labeling. Before coming back to graduate school for my Ph.D. degree, I worked as a software engineer for both Oracle (Solaris) and SUSE Linux.
