# About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Indiana University](https://www.indiana.edu/). I major in [Computational Linguistics](https://cl.indiana.edu/) and minor in [Computer Science](https://cs.indiana.edu/). My research interests are interpretability of NLP models, hybrid (neural and symbolic) methods, and artificial emotional intelligence. Before coming back to graduate school for my Ph.D. degree, I worked as a software engineer for [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/index.html) and [SUSE Linux](https://www.suse.com/). I also took an internship with [Interactions LLC](https://www.interactions.com/ai-technology/) and worked on dialogue systems.
